# Daisy Engine
A multiplayer server engine in TypeScript, inspired by Colyseus.

## ⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS
This project is **_NOT_** yet finished.
It is mostly undocumented and untested, many features are not yet implemented, some features are probably implemented wrong and it is likely that **breaking changes will be made** before it is released.

### Should I use this instead of Colyseus?
**NO**. This is not production-ready, and there's no guarantee it will ever be production-ready.

It is just a hobby side project I made to better understand TypeScript.
